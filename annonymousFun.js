// This is called a Annonymous Function
/*
This is an anonymous function expression that executes right away,
 and outputs "Hi i am hacker @!" immediately.
 * Note that the function has no name and is not stored in a variable <=
 * The two parentheses () at the end of the function expression       <=
 * cause it to be immediately executed or invoked
 * This pattern is known as an immediately invoked function expression or IIFE.
